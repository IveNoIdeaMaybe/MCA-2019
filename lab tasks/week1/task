  <strong>Week 1 </strong> <br>
The theme of my dataset is Jazz music, more specifically Thomas “fats
Waller. The innovator of the Harlem stride style he laid the groundwo
rk for modern jazz piano. Other than the piano he was a proficient vi
olinist, organ player and singer. Two of his most well known compositio
ns “aint misbehavin” and “honeysuckle rose” have been inducted into the
Grammy Hall of Fame. Fats copyrighted over 400 compositions before his d
eath in 1943, more than 10 copyrighted compositions for every year he li
ved.  I have chosen jazz and more specifically fats for my dataset as the
music is one of the most unpredictable and difficult to play. The complic
ated scores will be interesting to encode and might shine a light upon sh
ortcomings of digital systems when dealing with such a varied and deep genre. <br>

<strong>Notated data </strong><br> 
There is quite a lot of notated data for my chosen topic, howev
er as many of jazz’ pioneers and innovators were not classical
ly trained they would often play instruments in a way that was d
ifficult to express on sheet paper therefore there were many new
additions made due to the new style played by theses musicians. 

<strong>Acoustic data </strong><br>
There is a plethora of acoustic data that can be found on all the maj
or streaming services and on physical representations, cd’s etc. Howeve
r jazz is quite a bit more rare today than half a century ago and there
fore recordings are much more prevalent than real life interaction. 

<strong>Descriptive data </strong> <br>
Since Fats Waller was such an innovator there is widespread
descriptive data on him and his work. Not to mention the tw
o compositions that are in theGrammy Hall of Fame there are f
ull in depth biographies on websites such as the encyclopedia 
britannica. There is a lot of information on the multiple biog
raphies and studies into the life and accomplishments of Fats W
aller including who he worked with and influenced. This kind of 
data lends itself to being able to create a playlist of similar 
artists of the time. However mostly because of the time he was a
ctive the best information we can get is from the original record
ings and packaging which includes information such as who he worke
d with on the piece. Furthermore because it is a somewhat a specif
ic genre there are plenty of compilations of artists which were ma
de before the digital age but readily create a profile of Fats by w
ho he is commonly placed with. A product of the time his recordings
are not compiled into albums but limited to vinyl records therefore t
here is a hard stop on how long a piece could be. Modern efforts have
digitised his more popular works into best of’s etc
