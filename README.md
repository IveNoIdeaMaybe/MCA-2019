  <strong>Week 1 </strong>
The theme of my dataset is Jazz music, more specifically Thomas “fats Waller. The innovator of the Harlem stride style he laid the groundwork for modern jazz piano. Other than the piano he was a proficient violinist, organ player and singer. Two of his most well known compositions “aint misbehavin” and “honeysuckle rose” have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Fats copyrighted over 400 compositions before his death in 1943, more than 10 copyrighted compositions for every year he lived.  I have chosen jazz and more specifically fats for my dataset as the music is one of the most unpredictable and difficult to play. The complicated scores will be interesting to encode and might shine a light upon shortcomings of digital systems when dealing with such a varied and deep genre. <br>

<strong>Notated data </strong><br> 
There is quite a lot of notated data for my chosen topic, however as many of jazz’ pioneers and innovators were not classically trained they would often play instruments in a way that was difficult to express on sheet paper therefore there were many new additions made due to the new style played by theses musicians. 

<strong>Acoustic data </strong><br>
There is a plethora of acoustic data that can be found on all the major streaming services and on physical representations, cd’s etc. However jazz is quite a bit more rare today than half a century ago and therefore recordings are much more prevalent than real life interaction. 

<strong>Descriptive data </strong> <br>
Since Fats Waller was such an innovator there is widespread descriptive data on him and his work. Not to mention the two compositions that are in theGrammy Hall of Fame there are full in depth biographies on websites such as the encyclopedia britannica. There is a lot of information on the multiple biographies and studies into the life and accomplishments of Fats Waller including who he worked with and influenced. This kind of data lends itself to being able to create a playlist of similar artists of the time. However mostly because of the time he was active the best information we can get is from the original recordings and packaging which includes information such as who he worked with on the piece. Furthermore because it is a somewhat a specific genre there are plenty of compilations of artists which were made before the digital age but readily create a profile of Fats by who he is commonly placed with. A product of the time his recordings are not compiled into albums but limited to vinyl records therefore there is a hard stop on how long a piece could be. Modern efforts have digitised his more popular works into best of’s etc
